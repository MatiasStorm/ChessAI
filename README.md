# ChessAI

Implementation of a chess game using the module PyGame.

The game only allows for single player mode, playing against a simple AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to search for the best move.
I have also implemented my own chess engine, which handles all the rules of the game.

## Controls:
- Hover over piece to show allowed moves.
- Right click to select piece, right click again to move piece (If the last click is not an allowed move the piece is deselected).
- Left click to deselect piece.
- r-key restarts the game.
